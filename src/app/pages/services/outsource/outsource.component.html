                  <h2>Carrying out projects of various complexity and size</h2>
                  <p>The pool of 450 full-time, English speaking experts allows us to accommodate the needs of:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li><strong>large-scale projects</strong> and <strong>projects with complex architectures</strong>: for example, during one of the projects – a large PLM platform for 20,000 retailers, manufacturers and suppliers – ScienceSoft involvement grew from 4 to 39 specialists in 2 years of cooperation, engaging the development, testing and BI teams</li>
                      <li><strong>small- and medium-scale projects:</strong> our smaller teams have proved efficient in creating software products from scratch as well as augmenting the customers’ teams</li>
                      <li><strong>projects with distributed teams and 3<sup>rd</sup> party vendors:</strong> backed by fluent English and good communication skills, our specialists always stay on the same page with other project stakeholders</li>
                      </ul>
                      <h2>Why develop a product with ScienceSoft?</h2>
                      <p>Because we will help you reduce uncertainty throughout the entire product life cycle thanks to:</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li><strong>Established processes</strong> and <strong>project management culture</strong>, as we:
                          <ul>
                          <li>use various software development methodologies to work efficiently with both well-defined and vague project scope</li>
                          <li>estimate, plan and test thoroughly to stay <strong>within budget</strong> and <strong>time</strong> during implementation</li>
                          <li>ensure regular communication with the customer</li>
                          </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li><strong>Expertise</strong>: over 50% of our developers are Seniors and Leads</li>
                          <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: our size enables short ramp-up time (2-4 weeks) and easy scaling up and down in line with your project’s needs</li>
                          <li><strong>Professional-looking UI</strong>: your software product will look equally modern and slick across all browsers and screens</li>
                          <li><strong>Elaborate architecture</strong>: ruling out performance problems and creating a stable foundation for future updates as your business grows</li>
                          <li><strong>High-quality programming</strong>: we do not achieve shorter time-to-market by compromising software quality – we achieve it by way of professionalism</li>
                          </ul>
                          <h2>Cooperation models</h2>
                          <p>This is how we can pitch in:</p>

                              <li><strong>Full cycle product development:</strong> you provide a specification or a dedicated Product Owner, and we build the software from the ground up</li>
                              <li><strong>Specific or standalone functionality development:</strong> to help you extend the offering, we create additional features or applications for your product which require certain development skills – for example, a mobile version, BI tool and so on</li>
                              <li><strong>Team augmentation:</strong> a flexible team or individual developers complement your project with the needed technology skills</li>
