                <p>ScienceSoft offers development of powerful, one-of-a-kind software intended to meet customers’ unique demands. Our skilled specialists know the game of business and deliver successful solutions that accord with all the specified requirements while invariably staying within time and budget limits. Along with full-cycle custom software development, we provide software maintenance and platform-based customization.</p>
                <h4>DEVELOPMENT PROCESS</h4>
                <p>With a serious and regardful attitude towards your business, we start from the point of concept examination: our specialists carefully analyze your needs and help you create a detailed software requirements specification, which is indispensable for implementing the project the way you envision it. We offer two most common and effective development methodologies: waterfall and agile.</p>
                <p>
                    While with waterfall you decide all the requirements for your project at the very start and get exactly what you need for a set price at a set time, with agile you are in charge during the whole development process and are welcome to add/change requirements and assess the already implemented functionality on the go.
                    <br>
                    Apart from development, ScienceSoft offers deployment and further maintenance of the existing software.
